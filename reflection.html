                <h3>Demonstrate ethical decision-making grounded in philosophical inquiry</h3>
                <p>In SPL 100, Introduction to Philosophy, we evaluated the Acts of Humans versus Human acts 
                    according to Thomas Aquinas. This means thinking about what people do because of free will. 
                    We need to study three things, the object, the end that the person wants to achieve, 
                    the intention, the purpose why the person is doing the act, and the circumstances, the consequences 
                    anticipated. In this way we can analyze our own decisions whether they are ethical or not. </p>

                <h3>Integrate the practice of charity with the skill of justice</h3>
                <p>Since my junior year of high school, I traveled to Frenchville, PA, for a mission trip with my 
                    home parish. I was able to go as a student until after my sophomore year of college. At this small 
                    retreat center that organizes helping the less fortunate in the area, they emphasize on Catholic Social 
                    Teaching as well and give you a different perspective of who the “poor” are. They define the poor as 
                    “someone who has a need that is not being met.” So, someone could be living comfortably, but cannot do 
                    their own landscaping. Us on the mission trip will go out there and do their landscaping. Just because 
                    they are not homeless, does not mean they are not poor. </p>
