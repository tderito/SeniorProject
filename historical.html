            <p>In SPS 392, Global Political Economy, we had a book review assignment. The book I chose, Creating a World Without Poverty, was about a man 
                from India using Social Business to end poverty. It made me realize that there are many different aspects of poverty and also different kinds 
                of poverty around the world. Poverty is not the own person’s fault, but can also be a result of their culture and place they live. It is not 
                their own responsibility to help them succeed, but businesses and others who have been more fortunate than them to help them. </p>

            <p>In SLA 201, Western Cultural Traditions II, we had an assignment called “Reacting to the Past,” where we were each given a role in a real-life 
                situation that happened in the past. Our task was to act as this person, based on their opinions, even if they are not your own. In this situation, 
                I was an educated young woman from London, sent to an American college that taught women that they have “the same right as man to intellectual culture 
                and development” but did not want to reform society for women to have equal rights. It was hard putting myself in that position because I do believe that 
                women are equal with men, but putting myself in that time period and these opinions, I could not express that. I realized how hard life was in past time 
                periods and cultures. This is also happening now with the pay gap. We need to fight for equality. </p>
