                <h3>Organize and manage resources in a creative way to achieve impact</h3>
                <p>In SBU 371, Training and Development, as a small group, we have to design 
                    our own training program. We had to use many resources including our own 
                    experience, Reeves Library Databases, in-class material, and examples 
                    of other training programs. Our final program followed a theory session 
                    and came together as one cohesive program using these sources. </p>

                <h3>Interpret quantitative and qualitative information to present a logical argument based on supporting data</h3>
                <p>In SCS 270, Computer Forensics, we studied disk partitions and how 
                    to find files on a computer disk. For one assignment we were given 
                    a partition and were tasked with finding what types of files were 
                    on the computer. Given a sort of key which files were which, we were 
                    able to create the argument as to why this file was a .jpeg, .gif, or 
                    other type of file. Not all of them were clear, and could be multiple 
                    types based on oneâ€™s own interpretation. </p>
