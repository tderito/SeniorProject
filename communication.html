            <p>In SCS 374, Software Engineering for Mobile Systems,we were assigned a final project at the very beginning 
                of the semester. This was a group project to design and create our own application from scratch. I inadvertently 
                became the project manager – organizing tasks and figuring out which member would be the best for which task. I 
                made it a point to communicate with my group members and see what could get done each week. I also made sure that 
                they liked what they were doing – most of the time they volunteered for a certain task. Between me and another student, 
                we shared responsibility of making sure things were done and we were on schedule.</p>

            <p>In Seminar Thinking and Writing, our final project was a research paper. Mine was about owning your own business. 
                Because my family owns their own small business, I had a source right there, but needed more information. I was 
                able to log into Reeves Memorial Library and use their technological resources to help form my argument and communicate it better. </p>
